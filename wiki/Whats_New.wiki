= What's old? =
Creating a connect4 game in which one player challenges the computer using Artificial Intelligence, but what we did was nothing like that. of course they both are Connect4 game, but ours has some different features that might make you try playing it.

= So, What's new? =
  # Networked
  # Score
  # Chat
  # Open source


  * Networked:
  One of the main features we implemented in our project is using networking to make friends in the same network play together and have fun.
  * Score:
  And to make it more fun, everytime you win we'll raise your score by one until someone exits the game.
  * Chat:
  Of course it'd be boooooooring if you can't talk to the other player, and that's why we implemented a simple chat application to comfort you by letting you not need any instant messaging application while playing.
  * Open source:
  The most amazing feature is that this project is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License GPL]ed so you can take the source and modify it as much as you want.
